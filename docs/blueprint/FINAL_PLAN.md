# Final Plan for PennyGPT: A Local, Voice-Interactive AI Assistant

## Vision
PennyGPT is a privacy-first, locally running AI assistant that interacts via natural voice, executes tasks, and integrates with local apps and data. It is designed for extensibility, modularity, and user control.

## Architecture Overview
- **Core Engine**: Handles intent routing, session management, and plugin orchestration.
- **LLM Engine**: Interfaces with local or remote LLMs (OpenAI, Llama, etc.) for natural language understanding and generation.
- **Audio Stack**: Modular STT (speech-to-text) and TTS (text-to-speech) engines, supporting Whisper, local models, and cloud APIs.
- **Plugin System**: Extensible plugins for app integration, automation, and custom skills.
- **UI Layer**: CLI, desktop, and web interfaces for voice/text interaction.
- **Data Layer**: Local storage for context, history, and user data, with privacy controls.

## Key Features
- Local-first: All processing on-device by default; cloud optional.
- Voice-first: Fast, accurate STT/TTS pipeline.
- Extensible: Easy plugin creation and management.
- Secure: User data never leaves device unless explicitly allowed.
- Multi-modal: Supports text, voice, and (future) vision.

## Major Components
- `main.py`: Entry point, session loop, CLI/voice UI.
- `intent_router.py`: Intent classification, routing to skills/plugins.
- `llm_engine.py`: LLM abstraction, prompt management.
- `stt_engine.py` / `src/audio/stt_whisper.py`: Speech-to-text pipeline.
- `tts_engine.py` / `src/audio/tts_engine.py`: Text-to-speech pipeline.
- `src/ai/gpt_client.py`: LLM API client (OpenAI, local models).
- `src/ai/personality.py`: Persona, context, and prompt engineering.
- `src/audio/listener.py`: Audio input, VAD, microphone management.
- `penny.py`: Core assistant logic, plugin orchestration.

## Data Flow
1. **Audio Input** → STT → Intent Router → LLM/Plugin → Response → TTS → Audio Output
2. **Text Input** → Intent Router → LLM/Plugin → Response → Text/Audio Output

## Extensibility
- Plugins: Add new skills, app integrations, automations.
- Engines: Swap STT/TTS/LLM modules easily.
- UI: CLI, desktop, web, mobile (future).

## Security & Privacy
- Local storage, encrypted context/history.
- No cloud calls unless user opts in.
- API keys stored securely.

## Testing & Dev Workflow
- Unit tests in `test_gpt_smoke.py`, `src/`, and `whisper/tests/`.
- Run with `python main.py` (CLI) or via UI.
- Modular design for rapid prototyping.

## Future Directions
- Vision (image/video input).
- Advanced plugin marketplace.
- Mobile and web UIs.
- Federated/local LLM training.
